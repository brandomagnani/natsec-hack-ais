## Overview

Welcome to the Next-Gen Marine Intelligence Platform! This project leverages state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML), Large Language Models (LLMs), and a modern web frontend (built with Next.js) to provide advanced analysis and insights from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.

Our goal is to demonstrate an AI co-pilot system capable of:

* **Vessel Threat Scoring:** Evaluating potential risks associated with specific vessels or fleets based on historical data and real-time behavior.
* **Continuous Spoofing Monitoring:** Detecting anomalies and potential manipulation in AIS signals to identify vessels attempting to hide or falsify their identity or location.
* **Behavioral Classification:** Categorizing vessel activities (e.g., fishing, loitering, transiting) using ML models trained on movement patterns.
* **Autonomous Response Planning:** Simulating potential response strategies or generating recommendations based on identified threats or anomalous behaviors, utilizing LLM capabilities for nuanced understanding and planning.

This repository contains the source code for both the frontend user interface and the backend ML/LLM processing components.

## Key Features

* **Interactive Map Interface:** Visualize vessel positions, tracks, and alerts in real-time. (Built with Next.js)
* **AI-Powered Threat Assessment:** Get automated risk scores for vessels based on configurable parameters and learned patterns.
* **Spoofing Detection:** Identify potentially deceptive AIS transmissions through advanced algorithms.
* **Behavior Analysis:** Understand vessel activities automatically classified by ML models.
* **LLM-Driven Insights & Planning:** Utilize LLMs to interpret complex situations, summarize findings, and suggest potential courses of action.
* **Modular Architecture:** Designed for extensibility and integration with various data sources and models.

1.  **User Interaction:** Users access the platform via the Next.js web application.
2.  **Frontend:** Displays vessel data on maps, dashboards, and lists. Sends requests to the backend API for data and analysis.
3.  **Backend API:** Handles requests, retrieves data from the database, preprocesses AIS data, invokes ML models for analysis (threat scoring, classification, spoofing detection), interacts with LLMs for insights/planning, and returns results to the frontend.
4.  **ML/LLM Components:** Specialized modules for performing specific AI tasks.
5.  **Database:** Stores historical AIS data, vessel information, model outputs, user configurations, etc.
6.  **AIS Data Source:** Ingests real-time or batch AIS data feeds. (Details on data ingestion mechanism TBD).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.9 or later recommended)
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (Strongly Recommended)
* Access to an AIS Data Feed or historical dataset.
* API Keys for any external services (e.g., LLM APIs, Map Tiles).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    * Create `.env` files based on the provided `.env.example` files in both the `frontend` and `backend` directories (you might need to create these example files).
    * Fill in necessary values like database credentials, API keys, data source endpoints, etc.
    ```bash
    cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
    cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
    # Now edit the .env files with your specific configuration
    ```

3.  **Build and Run using Docker Compose (Recommended):**
    * Ensure Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine + Compose) is running.
    * From the root directory:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    This command will build the images for the frontend, backend, and database (if defined in your `docker-compose.yml`) and start the containers in detached mode.

4.  **Manual Setup (Alternative):**

    * **Backend:**
        ```bash
        cd backend
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        # Run database migrations if applicable (e.g., Alembic, Django migrations)
        # alembic upgrade head
        # Load initial data if necessary
        ```

    * **Frontend:**
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        npm install # or yarn install
        ```

### Running the Application

* **Docker Compose:**
    * The application should be accessible after `docker-compose up`. Check your `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` files for the frontend port (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
    * To view logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
    * To stop: `docker-compose down`

* **Manual:**
    * **Run Backend:**
        ```bash
        cd backend
        source venv/bin/activate # If not already active
        # Example using Uvicorn for FastAPI
        uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
        # Or for Flask: flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
        ```
    * **Run Frontend (in a separate terminal):**
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        npm run dev # or yarn dev
        ```
    * Access the frontend, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to the running frontend application (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
2.  Explore the map interface to view vessel positions.
3.  Interact with the dashboard elements to see threat scores, detected spoofing events, and behavioral classifications.
4.  Use the planning or insight features powered by the LLM.
5.  *\[Add more specific usage instructions as the UI/UX develops]*

## Data

* This system relies on AIS data. You will need to configure a connection to a live AIS stream or load historical AIS data into the database.
* *\[Provide details on the expected AIS data format, how to load sample data, or configure the data pipeline.]*
